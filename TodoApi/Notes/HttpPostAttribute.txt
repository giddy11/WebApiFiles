public class HttpPostAttribute : Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Routing.HttpMethodAttribute

Constructors
HttpPostAttribute()		Creates a new HttpPostAttribute.
HttpPostAttribute(String)	Creates a new HttpPostAttribute with the given route template.

Properties
HttpMethods	The list of http methods this action provider supports. (Inherited from HttpMethodAttribute)

Name		Gets the route name. The route name can be used to generate a link using a specific route, instead 
		of relying on selection of a route based on the given set of route values. (Inherited from HttpMethodAttribute)

Order		Gets the route order. The order determines the order of route execution. Routes with a lower order value are tried first.
		When a route doesn't specify a value, it gets the value of the Order or a default value of 0 if the RouteAttribute doesn't
		define a value on the controller. (Inherited from HttpMethodAttribute)

Template	The route template. May be null. (Inherited from HttpMethodAttribute)

Explicit Interface Implementations
IRouteTemplateProvider.Order		Gets the route order. The order determines the order of route execution. Routes with a lower order 
					value are tried first. When a route doesn't specify a value, it gets a default value of 0. A null value
					for the Order property means that the user didn't specify an explicit order for the route. (Inherited from HttpMethodAttribute)
